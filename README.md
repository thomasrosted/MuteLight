# MuteLight

## About
MuteLight allows you to control one or more Hue lights based on the mute state of your default communication device on your Windows computer. It's tested and working with Microsoft Teams, but has no specific ties to that so it will probably work for Zoom, Slack, Google Meet etc. as well.

Written in C#/.NET Framework 4.8. Relies on three wonderful packages, [Q42.HueApi](https://github.com/Q42/Q42.HueApi), [AudioSwitcher](https://github.com/xenolightning/AudioSwitcher) and [spectre.console](https://github.com/spectresystems/spectre.console).

## Getting started
Build and run. A friendly guide will get you set up, including authenticating with your Hue bridge and selecting the lights you want to control.
